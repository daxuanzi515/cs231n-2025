Tips:

All assignments are PDFs and they can be run and converted in `jupyter notebook`.

Mine default folder is `D:/PyCharmTest/PyCharmPackets/Jupyter_files/Desktop/cs231n`, you should put your `.ipynb` in here.

Cloud Server: `Colab` and `google Driver` 

Localization: Launch Command: `jupyter notebook`, go to `http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Desktop/cs231n/assignments*`
