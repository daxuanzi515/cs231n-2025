### Goals

In this assignment you will practice writing backpropagation code, and training Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

- Understand **Neural Networks** and how they are arranged in layered architectures.
- Understand and be able to implement (vectorized) **backpropagation**.
- Implement various **update rules** used to optimize Neural Networks.
- Implement **Batch Normalization** and **Layer Normalization** for training deep networks.
- Implement **Dropout** to regularize networks.
- Understand the architecture of **Convolutional Neural Networks** and get practice with training them.
- Gain experience with a major deep learning framework, such as **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**.

### Setup

**Ensure you have followed the [setup instructions](/setup-instructions) before proceeding.**

**Install Packages**. Once you have the starter code, activate your environment (the one you installed in the [Software Setup]({{site.baseurl}}/setup-instructions/) page) and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

**Download CIFAR-10**. Next, you will need to download the CIFAR-10 dataset. Run the following from the `assignment2` directory:

```bash
cd cs231n/datasets
./get_datasets.sh
```
**Start Jupyter Server**. After you have the CIFAR-10 data, you should start the Jupyter server from the
`assignment2` directory by executing `jupyter notebook` in your terminal.

Complete each notebook, then once you are done, go to the [submission instructions](#submitting-your-work).

### ✅Q1: Fully-connected Neural Network (20 points)

The notebook `FullyConnectedNets.ipynb` will introduce you to our
modular layer design, and then use those layers to implement fully-connected
networks of arbitrary depth. To optimize these models you will implement several
popular update rules.

### ✅Q2: Batch Normalization (30 points)

In notebook `BatchNormalization.ipynb` you will implement batch normalization, and use it to train deep fully-connected networks.

### ✅Q3: Dropout (10 points)

The notebook `Dropout.ipynb` will help you implement Dropout and explore its effects on model generalization.

### ✅Q4: Convolutional Networks (30 points)
In the IPython Notebook `ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb` you will implement several new layers that are commonly used in convolutional networks.

### ✅Q5: PyTorch / TensorFlow on CIFAR-10 (10 points)
For this last part, you will be working in either TensorFlow or PyTorch, two popular and powerful deep learning frameworks. **You only need to complete ONE of these two notebooks.** You do NOT need to do both, and we will _not_ be awarding extra credit to those who do.

Open up either `PyTorch.ipynb` or `TensorFlow.ipynb`. There, you will learn how the framework works, culminating in training a  convolutional network of your own design on CIFAR-10 to get the best performance you can.

### Start Point
Copy codes into your beginning of jupyter notebook and run them.

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
FOLDERNAME = "cs231n/assignments/assignment2/"
assert FOLDERNAME is not None, "[!] Enter the foldername."
import sys
sys.path.append('/content/drive/My Drive/{}'.format(FOLDERNAME))
%cd /content/drive/My\ Drive/$FOLDERNAME/cs231n/datasets/
!bash get_datasets.sh
%cd /content/drive/My\ Drive/$FOLDERNAME
```

### Submitting your work

**Important**. Please make sure that the submitted notebooks have been run and the cell outputs are visible.

Convert your answer of Part A and all notebooks of Part B to pdfs, and concatenate them into one pdf file. **Submit the pdf to the Gradescope.**

Compress and package the entire assignment. Then submit the zip file as ***“CS280_[Your full name]_[Your student ID].zip”*** to the **ShanghaiTech network disk**： https://epan.shanghaitech.edu.cn/l/LFrVDh.  We will check the uploaded code for plagiarism.
